# STL (Standard Template Library ) Boilerplate

_This repository contains a collection of Boilerplate codes for_ __STL (Standard Template Library)__ _which demonstrates the following aspects for each container_ 

- Creation of the containers
- Inserting elements into the containers
- Deleting elements from containers

__To learn about STL, I'll recommend a youtube video series located [[HERE]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg3cTlJVXa8&list=PL_dsdStdDXbq8BTjGdUEWgWYFWYP6pwYb) . It contains short videos which explains each and every aspect of STL in a understandable way. its highly recommended to see these videos to better understand STL__
